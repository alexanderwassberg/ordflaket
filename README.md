### History
**In short:**
Generates a combination of 2 prewritten words, forming a combo with a whole new meaning. Use it at the party or instead of scrolling through social media.

**History:**
Back in July 2012 me and my friend came up with word combinations that (for us) in swedish sounded hilarious. Sooo, I created a Google Drive document with the words we had come up with. Later to this day, the original list from 2012 got dusted off, polished and rearranged. I wanted to be able to share the words with my friends and family but in the easiest way possible. I built a script at uses the original list as a reference, forming new combinations. This means that the script can (as I'm writing) generate over 250 000 words!

Enjoy!
